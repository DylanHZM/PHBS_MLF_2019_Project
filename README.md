## Project Description
| Project  |  Details |
|---|---|
| **Goal**  |  To predict a binary result of each patient wether he/she would be released in a certain time period *(threshold TBD here)*. |
| **Data**  |  [COVID-19 in South Korea](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset)  on Kaggle|
| **Data Description**  |  This dataset depicts about COVID-19 in South Korea, including cases, patients, patient routes, regions, search trends, seaoul floatingg, time, time/age, time/gender, and weather. Figures in this dataset have been structured from public materials of KCDC and local governments.|

- `age` theage of the patient  
- `country` the country of the patient  
- `province` the province of the patient  
- `city` the city of the patient  
- `disease` TRUE: underlying disease / FALSE: no disease  
- `infection_case` the case of infection  
- `infection_order` the order of infection  
- `infected_by` the ID of who infected the patient  
- `contact_number` the number of contacts with people  
- `symptom_onset_date` the date of symptom onset  
- `confirmed_date` the date of being confirmed  
- `released_date` the date of being released  
- `deceased_date` the date of being deceased  
- `state` isolated / released / deceased
